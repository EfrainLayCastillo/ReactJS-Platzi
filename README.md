## What is React.JS
React is a library that allow us to create user interface focused the view using MVC. 

## Fundamental concept
- JSX: Its a extension file used to build html into javascript class
- Virtual DOM: Its a copy of the real DOM, it catch events or actions of each components pieces to be represent in the real DOM.
- Live cycle: Its a initialize state until the finally state. Its a diferente phases of the states.
- States: Allow the comunication of states in the app, triggered by events.
- Events: Trigger actions using the DOM Call
- Hooks: Key Methods to handle states and events into the app.

### JSX
It is the file extension used in react where we can make html inside js making it easy to use by getting the best out of html css and js.

### Virual DOM
It is a copy of the real DOM and what it does is compare it, so when there is a change, the entire screen does not have to be rendered, but only what was changed, improving the performance of our app, as I mentioned before, this is why it is compared the Virtual DOM with the Real DOM finding the changes.

### Lifecycle
This concept is widely known in programming, in this course we are going to know what is the life cycle of the elements that we are going to create in react since it is born, it is combined until it dies.

### State
This is fundamental, since we can see the states and see how the information flows between components through inputs, buttons, interactions between other elements.
